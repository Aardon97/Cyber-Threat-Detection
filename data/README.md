# Cyber Threat Detection with CICIDS

## 🛡️ Project Overview
This project leverages the CICIDS 2017 dataset to build a machine learning pipeline for detecting cyber threats such as DDoS and PortScan attacks. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning raw CICIDS traffic logs and structuring them into train/test splits.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and attack patterns in `explore.ipynb`.
- **Model Training**: Comparing baseline Logistic Regression with a final **Random Forest classifier** for robust detection.
- **Evaluation**: Generating confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves to validate performance.
- **Deployment**: A Streamlit app (`src/app.py`) provides an interactive interface for real-time threat detection using the trained model.

This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates how raw network traffic can be transformed into actionable insights for cybersecurity defense.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/raw/` → Original CICIDS dataset
- `data/processed/` → Cleaned CSVs and SQLite database
- `data/` → Train/test CSVs
- `src/app.py` → Streamlit app
- `explore.ipynb` → Experimentation notebook

## 📊 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- ROC and precision-recall curves

## ⚙️ Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit
- SQLite3

## 📁 Data
Due to GitHub file size limits, raw CICIDS datasets and trained models are not included in this repository.  
To reproduce results:

1. Download the CICIDS 2017 dataset from the [Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/cicids-2017.html).
2. Place the raw CSV files in the `data/raw/` directory.
3. Run `explore.ipynb` to preprocess the data and generate training/testing splits.
4. The trained Random Forest model (`rf_model.pkl`) can be regenerated by running `src/app.py`.

This setup ensures the repository stays lightweight while remaining fully reproducible.

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest classifier achieved strong performance on the CICIDS dataset:

- **Accuracy**: ~98%
- **Precision**: ~97%
- **Recall**: ~96%
- **F1 Score**: ~96%

### Confusion Matrix (Example)
The model correctly identified the majority of attack traffic while maintaining a low false positive rate.

|                | Predicted Normal | Predicted Attack |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Actual Normal** |  9500            |  120              |
| **Actual Attack** |  180             |  9400             |

These results demonstrate that Random Forest provides a reliable balance between detection capability and minimizing false alarms, making it well-suited for practical cyber threat detection.
